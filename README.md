In this repository you find a Power BI series of dashboards whcih I created during the course "Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence" by Maven Analytics (15 hours).

In the course I used Power Query to ingest, clean and transform data coming from CSV files. I also created a dimensional data model inside Power BI using best practices for business analytics. And, I created dashboards showing KPIs, tables and charges to support data-driven decision-amking.
